## üìñ Project Overview

This project focused on the **CFD analysis of missile aerodynamics**, studying a tangent ogive / cylinder body missile geometry to compute aerodynamic coefficients (normal, axial, and moment) under high-speed conditions. The primary objective was to assess how different turbulence models in a RANS framework capture high-speed flow behavior, offering insights into their effectiveness in modeling such conditions.
